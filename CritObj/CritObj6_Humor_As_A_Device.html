		<p> The device allows a user to perform digital allyship for a number of issues at the press of a button. When a
			button is lit up, the user can press it to create a post on Bluesky. As the button is pressed, an angelic
			noise plays.</p>

		<h2 id="ideation">Ideation Process</h2>

		<p>
			We had a discussion today and tried to get to the bottom of our
			proposal. This process led to the discarding of the form of the
			megaphone. This out and about protest was not what we felt is
			necessary to critique. The topic was focused on performative digital
			allyship. The central idea we are trying to critique is this easy
			activism, activated at the press of a button, from a desk, while
			sitting at home working remotely. We shopped around and selected this
			button because we could UV print logos on top and it has an
			integrated LED. We discussed having it be like an advent calendar, a
			ritual activity performed over time. Integrated into the user's life.

		<h2 id="cardboard">Cardboard Phase</h2>
		<p>
			After the button came, we did some prototyping in cardboard to see how it
			would fit on a device. If I were to do this again, I would do the
			cardboard prototyping first before we got the button as a way to
			inform its size, because even after we measured it all out, we were
			still surprised by its width and depth.
		</p>

		<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px; margin: 20px 0;">
			<img src="media/cardboard-prototype-1.jpg" alt="Initial cardboard prototype"
				style="flex: 1; max-width: 50%;" />
			<img src="media/cardboard-prototype-2.jpg" alt="Second cardboard prototype iteration"
				style="flex: 1; max-width: 50%;" />
		</div>

		<p>
			This was our first version. I like that it sits on the desk well and faces
			the user. I like that it keeps the depth of the button hidden. At
			this point in the process, we had spent a long time talking about
			what to do and had not yet been able to build and the angles of this
			piece felt too challenging for the time we had left to build. I think
			that its tilt came back in at the end when we added the picture
			frame.
		</p>

		<img src="media/power-strip-iteration.jpg" alt="Power strip-like design iteration" />
		<p>
			This design is way too much like a power strip, and with the depth of the
			buttons we would have to make it so much taller than wide.
		</p>

		<img src="media/alternative-form-exploration.jpg" alt="Alternative form exploration" />
		<p>
			This form we did next was compelling because its lack of definition
			allowed us to explore a couple different configurations.
		</p>

		<img src="media/palm-rest-concept.jpg" alt="Palm rest design concept" />
		<p>
			I love how this is almost like a palm rest, it's form suggests that the
			hand rests on it and selects.
		</p>

		<img src="media/minimal-form-exploration.jpg" alt="Minimal form exploration" />
		<p>
			In contrast, this form doesn't say much. We were still struggling with
			how to get these angles off a laser and so started to think, whats
			the best possible box we could do?
		</p>

		<img src="media/final-flat-prototype.jpg" alt="Final flat prototype" />
		<p>
			This final flat prototype was compelling because of the way it balances
			the height of the buttons with the length and width of the box. We
			had ordered 5 buttons so Kalinda and I figured that laying them out
			in balance with our speaker would be interesting "design". As I
			look back on this now, I wonder if our project would have been
			tighter if we had only 4 topics and the speaker was centered in the
			final column. This would allow us to show a flow from the action of
			pressing the button to the speaker as their realms are distinct and
			equal.
		</p>

		<!-- <p> ##@ Find home for this
			There was some talk of the device reading off the posts it was making. This
			would have functioned well in class as the punchline to the joke, and
			perhaps even in its final context as a desk bound device speaking its
			ideological message to its user for them to internalize. I think this
			distinction situates it between a work from home or office bound
			worker. I think the office workers device speaking is too literal of
			a virtue signal, where as the work from homer is complete in their
			isolation and might welcome the intrusion in their otherwise isolated
			work environment.
		</p> -->
		<h2 id="cad">Cad and Laser Cutting</h2>
		<p>
			Moving quickly from here, I wanted to quickly generate some files that could
			be laser cut. First I did a rough block out of the button.
		</p>

		<img src="media/button-block-out.png" alt="Button block out design" />

		<p>
			Then I made the box around it. I tried to copy the flat version we had
			made and used a quick little plug in to turn the butt end joints into
			these makerbox style ones. Typically I dislike this look but with the
			promise of finishing on the table it was an easy decision.
		</p>

		<img src="media/box-joints-design.png" alt="Box design with joints" />
		<img src="media/box-assembly-complete.png" alt="Complete box assembly design" />

		<p>
			The back of the box was two layers thick of the ply so that it would have
			something to index into on the back as a press fit. This interaction
			unfortunately later pushed cracks into the fragile wood fill.
		</p>

		<p>
			When everything fit (first try no big deal), we glued it up and Kalinda
			brought it home and performed the sanding and finishing process.
		</p>

		<img src="media/assembled-finished-box.jpg" alt="Assembled and finished box" />

		<p>
			Or well, not everything was done though. When we talked about the power
			solution it was decided to put the through hole for the power cable
			into the back and have it propped up standing via a picture frame
			hinge. I took the opportunity to recut the back panel as a better
			press fit and with the hole for the USB-C pass through in place. I
			think this intervention was critical to lending a premium feel to the
			device, to make it something that can be plugged in to live on a
			desk.
		</p>

		<img src="media/back-panel-redesign.png" alt="Back panel redesign" />
		<h2 id="buttons">Buttons Making</h2>
		<p>
			Using these same models, I created a simple cardboard jig to stead the
			buttons in place on the uv printer where we splashed the logos onto
			the buttons.
		</p>

		<img src="media/uv-printing-setup.png" alt="UV printing setup diagram" />
		<img src="media/uv-printing-process.jpg" alt="UV printing process" />

		<p>
			This process was sloppy and could have been better if I didn't use a
			cardboard jig and spent more time perfecting the alignment of the
			print head with test pieces.
		</p>
		<h2 id="electronics">Electronics</h2>
		<p>
			The electronics was the first thing I prototyped and its development went
			hand and hand with the code. I used one of those cheap esp32's from
			aliexpress and wired it to a led and a button. I developed the basic
			code to get a post going where in the led pulses and then when a
			button is pressed, a string is posted to bluesky. I expanded this
			code out to include 5 buttons and 5 leds so as to control the full
			number of buttons. I swore I would never put a breadboard into a
			final build but, here it is.
		</p>

		<p>
			This was a fun exercise though. At the end of the day, I didn't even
			bother to remove the initial buttons I had used to prototype the
			board. I just wired in the final ones over the top. The biggest issue
			is that I have to pray none of the wires come out, but for a quick
			presentation it help up okay. The bigger mistake was gluing it all
			together as a final adhesion technique. If I had taken more time, it
			would have been nice to clean it up so the press fit we had designed
			would work, because the wiring kept pushing the lid off the back, but
			its fine.
		</p>

		<img src="media/electronics-assembly.jpg" alt="Electronics assembly" />

		<p>
			One final thing with the electronics integration. As we set the whole
			line up of the breadboard, the esp32 and the cable, there was no room
			for it all to fit! I quickly cut the extra off the breadboard with
			the bandsaw (sorry ian and phil) and everything went in juuuuust
			right. Sometimes you get lucky.
		</p>


		<img src="media/breadboard-modified-fit.jpg" alt="Modified breadboard fit" />
		<h2 id="code">THE CODE</h2>
		<p>
			I spent time with Pedros github esp32 examples data json HTTP. This
			was my first time accessing a website for a project and the first
			time I have used Json as well! I keep seeing them come up all over
			the place, so its nice to get a little idea of what the famous Json
			is.
		</p>

		<p>
			Our first major player is WiFi.h, our goated library for connecting to
			the internet I created some constant variables of the type char* to
			hold the wifi name and the itp 3g password. Apparently a char* means
			that its a set of characters, which is close to but different from a
			string, and this is standard for wifi libraries. When we get to
			setup, I began the serial at the number esp32's like 115200 and set
			my pin modes. I wanted the built in led to do something, but its
			captured by the wifi library so this line is useless. Then I set our
			button to be an input.
		</p>

		<p>
			WiFi.begin takes our two char*'s from earlier, the network name and the
			password. Then I check the wifi status every half a second, printing
			out a count up with periods, until we get the string we are looking
			for WL_CONNECTED. I have it print connected and were off.
		</p>

		<p>
			As the last part of the setup, lets log into the api for bluesky. I
			have this as a function called login() which will fill in two
			variables I created earlier which hold the access token and the did,
			which I am not sure what it is. We start with HTTPClient making a
			little operator called http, this is what were going to use to do
			stuff with. Http begin allows us to connect to a api page to create a
			session to post through and http.addHeader does some other stuff
			pertaining to the content type and the JSON. Basically this whole
			section gets a couple variables which allow me to continue posting
			after setup.
		</p>

		<p>
			First off, let me talk about HTTP. HTTP is a web transfer protocol, like
			tor or I2p. Its funny to compare the three because http is so much
			more common place, its just the default damn near everything.
		</p>

		<p>
			So we bring HTTPClient.h into the sketch, thats the library we use to
			get the esp32 to connect to the internet, so through wifi it reaches
			out to the api for bluesky, which is open and well published and easy
			to interact with.
		</p>

		<p>
			The loop selects a certain set of buttons to be pressed and waits When it
			does, it looks for my access token from earlier and uses http to
			begin interacting with bluesky. It sends a payload with my text
			inside with the json library to bluesky and waits for a confirmation
			code. If it gets it, it sends to the usb serial that it was
			successful, otherwise, it gives me the error.
		</p>

		<p>
			Also in the code, I made the selection for the current issue random and an
			angelic sound play when a button is pressed. This involved the usage
			of a cheap amplifier and the hex code file of the sound we intended to
			play. The process was to take the wav file and downsample it as much
			as possible, I put it at a sampling rate of 8000. Then I saved it as
			an Unsigned 8-bit PCM. I converted that to the hex file which gets
			stored in angel.h.

		<h2 id="improvements">What we could have done better</h2>
		<p>When we demonstrated the piece in front of the class, there were a few unexpected occurrences. The esp 32 was
			unable to connect to wifi and had to be re flashed, this involved removing the box we had just hotglued
			shut, one of those times, aka every time, where a quick fix makes you more work. The second problem was the
			limited variety of texts I had been posting to the account causing bluesky to ban me for being a bot.
			Finally, the buttons did not light up enough in the light of the sun to make their illumination visible.
			Pedro suggested we take a video of when it was working so we had something to show worst case if it failed.
		</p>

		<p>Of the criticism we got, the most memorable was who do we see the device being used by. This was the most
			difficult question we had to answer. In my head, I had the user as a New York Times reading good Liberal
			with the right opinions, as informed by their pertinent research into the most important topics as informed
			by The Paper of Record. In this way, it would have been inappropriate to put anything related to Israel's
			war on Gaza on a button. I think if we had put something like a Bluesky X The New York Times print on the
			front it would have brought the whole thing home. Otherwise, it could be polished and slimmed so that it fit
			better onto the desk of the user.</p>
