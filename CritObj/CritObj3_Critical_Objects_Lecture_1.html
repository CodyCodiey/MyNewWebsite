        <h1>Critical Objects</h1>
        <h2>What are They?</h2>

        <p>Critical objects are strange things. They are Objects, physical tangible things, which are Critical, which exists in the ephemeral world of clouds as ideas and discussions.</p>

        <p>They are "Not the same as speculative design or speculative design fiction" and "not critical art"</p>

        <p>They are Fully Functional prototypes which Perform a Critique.</p>

        <p>They "Inherently perform the function of inciting discussion or critique."</p>

        <p>Maybe the best example is the Mine Kafon, a mine clearing device which transcends its literal role (lol) to start a discussion around the removal of leftover landmines.</p>

        <p>In this class, we are using a non-prescriptive framework developed by Pedro to analyze such devices.</p>

        <h3>Analysis Framework:</h3>

        <p><strong>Topic</strong> – What the device is about, this is easy to distill and digest</p>

        <p><strong>Device</strong> – How the device communicates as a literary object, sarcasm, metaphor, juxtaposition</p>

        <p><strong>Attribute</strong> – The essential aspects, be it wearable, edible, interactive, data driven</p>

        <p><strong>Mood</strong> – The overall vibe of the thing, how it is experienced.</p>

        <h3>Mine Kafon Analysis Example:</h3>

        <p><strong>The topic</strong> is warfare, specifically the use of mines in war and the impact they have on people after fighting ends</p>

        <p><strong>The device</strong> is metaphor because the device loses limbs like people, it starts whole and is torn apart by engagement with the mines in the landscape.</p>

        <p><strong>The attribute</strong> is mobile</p>

        <p><strong>The mood</strong> is a sort of DIY futurism</p>
