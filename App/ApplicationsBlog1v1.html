First assignment is pages 1-60 of infinite games, I have been asking
around and researching the book. I got it for under 20$ (I paid with
a 20 and got dollars back) at mcnally jackson in downtown brooklyn. I
had been there before because kaits aunt had gotten me a gift card
there and we went and I got two books by philip k dick who I was
getting into at the time, last summer.

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">I searched Infinite
Games James Case NYC saw it was on the shelf at 5am this morning and
walked over. I had two interactions with the people working there,
someone upstairs helped me find it in the self help section and
someone downstairs checked me out. I paid cash and he even knocked a
couple bucks off, he looked at it and said, this is shelf worn, like
a wine expert tasting a wine, this is shelf worn, ill knock dollars
off. Nice.</p>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">I read the first 60
pages, and I read some stuff about the book online. I stood out to me
when he quoted lacan, hegel, marx, jesus, and paul, but only for
single sentences without expounding through references to their other
work. Wait,,, is this guy a pseude? I talked about the book to a
friend and he said he read the book as a manual on how to start a
cult. On wikipedia it said a bunch of stuff, and at the bottom, it
said the book had mixed reviews. One stood out though, said the book
changed his life, from the guy who created wired magazine and edited
on the whole earth catalog, both things I know a little about but not
too much, because theyre before my time and magazines are so
temporal. Its always, the magazine was like this, or it was this way
and published this much, it was about this. Thats not really how you
understand a magazine, or at least, its difficult for me. I read that
its been used for business, I read that its underrated in the self
help cannon, at this point, Im like, Okay in class we are learning
about play theory so I’ll interpret the book in this context.

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">It stood out to me
in the lecture, the mention of an original idea vs an original
thought. This is interesting to me because there is this struggle
sometimes to make “something new,” which is wholly unproductive
in the activity of making new things. As a thing gets made, it shifts
and move around the person or people that made it, taking them in.
