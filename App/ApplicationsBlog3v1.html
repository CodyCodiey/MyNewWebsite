        <h1>One Orange Braincell: Writing as a Cat Role Play Experience</h1>
        
        <p>The purpose of this experience in the setting of Applications is to draw a contrast between the concepts of the dramatic and theatrical from Infinite Play by James P Carse. The game draws inspiration from interactive collaborative text based mediums like early twitter and free form role playing games like Everyone is John.</p>
        
        <p>In the experience, players are brought to the front of the room and counted off one through twenty four. Each players number corresponds to an hour of the day and asked to write about what the cat is doing then. Play takes place in two phases, they are first asked to write a fairly literal description of the cat's time. Players are then asked to reconsider the cat's timeline from a dramatic point of view, expanding its perspective into "what a cat thinks it's doing." The cat is first described as "sleeping" then "sleeping on John's chair."</p>
        
        <p>The experience is connected to social microblogging through the creation of live text by a diverse set of users. The process of reading and writing, and then reacting to the writing of others, and continuing to write on top of that. This, the essential spirit of the activity was maintained and amplified. There are no rules in a google doc, and so the ability of the participants to expand upon their assigned hours was noted and encouraged.</p>
        
        <p>The collaborative nature was exaggerated as all the participants worked together to tell the story of the cat's life in the day. In text based mediums like twitter, though they may be focused on a particular topic, the participants are often not on the same "team." The result from our mix was a combination of storytelling and roll play. The experience invited the participants to express themselves as writers and as people in each other's context. Social microblogging at its best resulted in community and in this small time I think we built a little more community here too.</p>
        
        <p>When the game was executed, we were continually surprised by the outcome. When we asked the participants to join and scan a qr code on their device, I was immediately hit by how annoying it is to have to scan a qr code. I was frustrated when participants were not willing and reminded of the times I have been annoyed being asked to scan something myself. While some people engaged fully and had a fun time writing, there were others I was not expecting who found the process of creative writing difficult. I thought it was something everyone would feel comfortable with. This made me examine my expectations of others. I think as time went on people got more comfortable writing. The I was surprised by how well the second half went as people began to find a rhythm and flow. That engagement excited me.</p>
        
        <p>If we were doing it again, I would want to hand computers out to everyone in the audience to type with. Asking the users to bring their own devices was something that I as a low deviced person am often annoyed with. I think it would bolster their creativity to be anonymous as well because some people were shy to write in public. It would also be worth considering experimenting with text entry happing linearly. Or secretly and then read off in the end.</p>
        
        <p>Overall, I wish things like this happened more often because seeing a flurry of text appear on a google doc page was a fun experience. I think developing this form could be a fun way of communal public expression. I could see experiences like this happening in public projector spaces, or writers workshops.</p>
