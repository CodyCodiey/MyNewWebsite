	Twitter changed my life man it really changed everything. When I was
a kid it was like, I had this idea of, if I shared everything about
myself how could anyone blame me? I could absolve myself of
everything, all those weird thoughts you have as a kid you don’t
really understand or know what to do with. In my highschool
relationships this turned out to be a disaster, sometimes the kindest
thing you can do for another person is keep somethings back, resolve
them for yourself.

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	I began to engage
more online as my irl small town relationships fell away in college
and the prospect of meeting an extended community on the internet who
“really got me” became more of a possibility. Initially, I began
posting on private discords for podcasts I was interested in, playing
the social game of going deeper and deeper into the wells of ever
niche’r communities. After grinding through this style, I took some
mutuals and began to post more publicly on twitter.</p>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	I remember where I
was as the pandemic set in. I have some 180 followers and was in
private communication with several. I remember being engaged in this
rapid flow of information, the linear time based “feed” with the
ability to throw more and more into it without reprocutions due to my
rapid pace of engagement. I would just post and post and post and
post and write about my send and write and write and write anything I
could any words I could drag out I wrote and after I wrote them I
thought up more and continued to write. Emotionally I found it very
satisfying and addictive to have every single though I produced seen
and interacted with, sometimes to great success.

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">	For the next few
years I continued, meeting more and more people, more and more of
whom transitioned from online to irl. During this period of creation
I met my current partner and several friends who I still know today.
Ultimately though, my thumb wore out and began to ache. Writing in
that mode had taken a toll on my body. My mind as well suffered as
the app degraded and was ultimately forever changed into a right wing
echochamber. Posting became financially comodified. Things came to an
end when my partner and I moved to new york because I was no longer
socially isolated and could engage with people in real life easily.

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Ultimatly the
driving force which I found to be so powerful was writing and sharing
writing and engaging in a creative process that was public.</p>
