the website makes clear, my name is Cody Frost. I am interested in
art, philosophy, and robotics. As such, I am less than an expert in
all three, a real living and breathing pseudo intellectual.  I’m
good at cad, I’m good at electronics, I’m good at some basic
mechanical engineering. I’m really good at reading and writing. I
have recently been practicing mental math, but please don’t quiz
me.</font></p>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><font color="#000000">Today,
I will write a little bit about this automaton known as “The
musician”. In the process of reading about different the historical
automatons that survived long enough to be documented, I was struck
by how divorced so many have become from their creators. Its properly
shelly! The automaton may not even be attributed, its maker may be
unknown! This one though, “The musician,” was created by the
Jaquet-Droz family, a father and sons, and is one of three automatons
they created between 1768 and 1774.</font></p>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><font color="#000000">I
am drawn to “The musician” because of the attention paid in its
creation to embodying signs of life. As the humanoid machine sits,
its hands move across the clavier before it. The eyes and head follow
the hands as the fingers play, carefully taping out the tune live on
instrument. It is described to breath as it plays, a mechanical
bellows operating its chest, in a way which the spectators of
antiquity described as emotionally infused, as if moved by song.
Impressively, the machine “knows” or “is programed with” six
possible selections.</font></p>

was created to sell mechanical watches and birds. Today, the
Jaquet-Droz brand of is owned by the conglomerate swatch.</font></p>
