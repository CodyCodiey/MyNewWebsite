        <img src="media/IMG_1525.gif" alt="Mechanical Eye Movement Prototype" />
        <p>I created this simple mechanism to control the movement of the eyes through a process of sketching and physical experimentation. I am trying to push through my difficulties with drawing and handwork, by the only means I know, drawing and hardworking. I am interested in playing with paper as it has two sides and thought about creating some puppetry to control a fish in a bowl. A fish is almost a 2d creature as it is, so I figured it would look good going flat as it turned to face the viewer. I could have both sides be different colors.</p>

<p>I started to sketch out the mechanism and began to learn a few
things. In the past, I have been a cad first creator. This has been
limiting for me because it requires a large degree of calculation and
design to make simple forms. As I get better at drawing, I will be
able to explore more forms quickly. Speed is so important. I also
like how drawing allows the brain to hold a more generative roll in
the creative process alowing paper and pen to operate as extended
physical memory. “working things out” on the page.

<p>I did not want to have only a piviot point as the mechenism, so I
thought about how to translate some rotational force of a crank into
the linear side to side that droves the fish. I also began to think
about putting the rod behind the fish so that it appears self moving
from the angle of viewing. Other considerations I ran into while
sketching are the length of the lever arm and pivot point being
proportional to their distances. It struck me that I did not want to
have a huge control lever resulting in a tiny amount of motion. It
also struck me how the end of the lever would result in an arc and I
would thusly need some other type of joinery to translate from that
radial motion into a linear one. Given time constraints, I began
thinking about a way to utilize the radial motion of the far end of
the lever as the final output of my system. Eyeballs came to me as a
an object which has a variety of motions, some of it could be radial
given the spherical shape of the eye. I wanted it to give off some
emotion as well, but short of “rolling ones eyes,” I figured
whatever came out would be just fine. Lets find the emotion in the
piece after the fact.

<p>The next thing I did was move to Ωillustrator because I thought I
would be able to use the laser cutter. Turns out to be against the
rules, but thats okay. It helped me clean up my thoughts a little
more and easily duplicate the forms I made to explore creating a
linked set of two eyes. Looking back on this now, I see that the
radious’s I was exploring for the movement of the level arm are
incorrect as they should be ceneted around the point of piviot. At
this time, I was still thinking about the lever arm as some kind of
round rod which could fit easily though a slip linkage translating
that radial force to the horizontal one I wanted for a clean side to
side eye movement.

<p>Finally I got my knife and pencil and hole punch and zipties out
and got to cutting. I was excited to use the ziptye joining method as
inspitted by this guide by adafruit on cardboard crafting.</p>

<p>This was a section I should have documented better. I need to sit
down to work with a camera in hand. Oh well. Here is the first tow
eye shapes I cut. I traced centered the lever rods on the hole
puncher and punched them, then did the same on my cardboard squares.
The resulting holes were too big for zip tyes to fit on as joinary,
so I had to get creative. The problem was solved by securing both
sides which would have laterial force on them using the long flat
section of the zip tie and looping it through the cardboard nearby. I
suppose this technique could be used on the top and bottom sides, but
that would only be required if it was rotating 360 degrees. For this
motion, it is acceptable to constrain only the sides. To get the
trace out of the path of the zip tie joinary region, I used my lever
arm as a compass and traced out the motion as it was constrained by
the ziptyes. Then I drew on the page someghing of an offset arc, and
then I offset that new arc again an equal distance to the bottom
making a curved slot on the page. You can see on the left my
technique was a bit sloppy and by number two I had gotten a little
cleaner. I constructed the mechenism twice before moving onto my
final build. I was careful to reuse some of the pieces I cut.

<p>Finally, with the single sheet remade, I mounted my lever arms,
eye circles, rotational zipties, and control arm zip tye pivots and a
freshly cut linking power input! My eyeball puppet was ready to
preform.
