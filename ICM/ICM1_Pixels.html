        <h1>Pixels!</h1>

        <p> Basically we leaned the basics of keeping all the data for an image on the screen with a 1d array called
            pixels. Calling pixels is really weird because there are so many pixel arrays that can be present. You
            can have one for an image, for the canvas, for videos, pixels keeps a lot of numbers in long line and
            you can break it down and do all sorts of stuff with it. </p>

        <p> What kind of stuff? Whatever you can figure out basically. Its hard to understand a (I am going to use
            the word image indescrimitibly the same way you would class a painting as "the image" or as painters as
            working with images.) Image as a 1d array. But we can break am image down atomically into a cartesian
            grid with 0,0 in the top corner and then it gets read straight across to the right until the page ends
            at whatever the distance of the rectangle is and we pick right back up on the at the left side of the
            page and repeat just like with english and it then goes on and on until the picture is known.</p>

        <p> Each pixel is made up of 4 values. Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha. Each value can be between 0 and 255. So
            a pure red pixel would be (255,0,0,255) and a pure green pixel would be (0,255,0,255) and a pure blue
            pixel would be (0,0,255,255). The alpha value is the transparency of the pixel so 255 is fully opaque
            and 0 is fully transparent. So if you wanted a semi transparent red you could do (255,0,0,127) (vscode
            autocompleted this whole paragraph)</p>

        <p> So to manipulate pixels you have to first load the pixels into the array with loadPixels() and then you
            can manipulate the pixels array directly. Each pixel takes up 4 spaces in the array so the first pixel
            is at index 0,1,2,3 and the second pixel is at index 4,5,6,7 and so on. So to get the red value of the
            first pixel you would do pixels[0] and to get the green value of the first pixel you would do pixels[1]
            and so on. Once you are done manipulating the pixels you have to call updatePixels() to update the
            canvas with the new pixel values.(vs code autocompleted that too lol)</p>

        <p> Okay, anyways. There are some ways to get through it using nested fore loops and a couple equations to
            isolate the index from x and y values. Or what else is really cool because then you can just count by
            four each time you go through. These were the things we were taught and so these were the foundation of
            the pixel array based image code my classmate Valarie and I wrote to manipulate our image for 60 seconds
        </p>

        <p> I had been reading a lot of the p5js book and understanding a lot of the basic ideas of the program. I
            know some arduino c so the most difficult thing is wrapping my head back around classes, objects, and
            arrays (lol).</p>

        <p> Coming up with ideas for the image was easy, understanding what's realistic as a way to code that image
            was very difficult. She wanted to do a transition from a picture to a framing, I wanted to talk about
            memory and how our mental images of people and events fade over time. We talked about how to do it with
            a picture of her cat and broke off after a couple hours of work on a zoom call some ideas on how to
            proceed. I am going to post some of the work we created as we went and talk about what was going on.
