            I am interested in art, philosophy, and robotics. 
            As such, I am less than an expert in all three, a real living and breathing pseudo intellectual. 
            I’m good at cad, I’m good at electronics, I’m good at some basic mechanical engineering. 
            I’m really good at reading and writing. I have recently been practicing mental math, but please don’t quiz me.

            Today, I will write a little bit about this automaton known as “The musician”. 
            In the process of reading about different the historical automatons that survived long enough to be documented, 
            I was struck by how divorced so many have become from their creators. 
            Its properly shelly! The automaton may not even be attributed, its maker may be unknown! 
            This one though, “The musician,” was created by the Jaquet-Droz family, a father and sons, 
            and is one of three automatons they created between 1768 and 1774.

            I am drawn to “The musician” because of the attention paid in its creation to embodying signs of life. 
            As the humanoid machine sits, its hands move across the clavier before it. The eyes and head follow the hands as the fingers play, 
            carefully taping out the tune live on instrument. It is described to breath as it plays, a mechanical bellows operating its chest, 
            in a way which the spectators of antiquity described as emotionally infused, as if moved by song. Impressively, the machine “knows” 
            or “is programed with” six possible selections.

            It was created to sell mechanical watches and birds. Today, the Jaquet-Droz brand of is owned by the conglomerate swatch.
