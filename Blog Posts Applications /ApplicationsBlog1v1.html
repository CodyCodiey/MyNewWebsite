First assignment is pages 1-60 of infinite games, I have been asking
around and researching the book. I got it for under 20$ (I paid with
a 20 and got dollars back) at mcnally jackson in downtown brooklyn. I
had been there before because kaits aunt had gotten me a gift card
there and we went and I got two books by philip k dick who I was
getting into at the time, last summer. 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">I searched Infinite
Games James Case NYC saw it was on the shelf at 5am this morning and
walked over. I had two interactions with the people working there,
someone upstairs helped me find it in the self help section and
someone downstairs checked me out. I paid cash and he even knocked a
couple bucks off, he looked at it and said, this is shelf worn, like
a wine expert tasting a wine, this is shelf worn, ill knock dollars
off. Nice.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">I read the first 60
pages. I stood out to me when he quoted lacan, hegel, marx, jesus,
and paul, but only for single sentences without expounding through
references to their other work. Wait, is this guy a pseude? It is
very interesting, the references he chooses. I found myself
unproductively nitpicking his interpretation of the various things he
quoted or cited or interpretations of historical events. There is
writing on wikipeida, of how its been used for business, therapy, a
friend of mine said it was about how to start a cult, kevin kelly a
wired editor and highly suspicious statistics goon, kevin kelly said
it changed his live. Carse writes about play to understand the world,
I am going charitably interpret his world to understand what he
thinks of as forms of play.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Case is setting out
a way of moving through the world which he describes in contrast to
something he terms as finite play. Play of this sort is defined by
limits in space and time and enforced by universal consent, the
intended outcome being the creation of dramatic scenarios which
follow the narrative structure of winners and losers. Society then is
built on these narratives with broad reaching implications broadly
reinforce its structure. 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">He criticizes the
recreation of this structure in the psyche, a process he refers to as
veiling. In short, the structure of finite games prefigures rolls in
which its participants must fill and in this process they are
alienated from the abstract nature of their reality. 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Infinite play then
is posited as a liberality state where a participant seeks to
outmanuver the limits of time and space while underminng the
essential drama of finite play through a re-embodiment of their veil
as a veil, through an interpritation of such as such. Mode of
understanding is fosteredwhich leans on the absurdity of finite play
and seeks to trancent its ideological mode. 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Case then sets into
the concept of the Master Player, a being driven by statistic
predictability, by forcloure, by the creation of limits, by the past,
by constant reference to past forms, by the regurgittion of past
forms as a creation of limits which forecloses the future from the
endless posabilities which case believes are inherent.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">So here then, do
society and culture butt heads, Here then are master players and
infinite players set to opposition. Society is this great object of
consent, repetition, norms, of boundaries. Culture is a sort of
mystic object which resists the grasp, a transcendental ideal suited
towards the types of engagement infinite players desire. 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Infinite players are
driven towards the total opposite. Infinite players exist in the
realm of creation through reinterpretation, through continuation.
Culture, case writes, is essentially infinite. It exists between
people throughout time without a goal, without winners, as the
valuation of each of its part as a mode of the whole. 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">I guess, of course I
want to be an infinite player, duhhhhhh. It seems like the obvious
position from which to move through life. This is where the book gets
its reputation as a self help classic, Just be infinite bro, trust
me! Realistically, I find this troubling as Case nears on the Stoic
ideal of freedom in slavery. If the slave simply cast their mind into
embodying their roll as a performance,  not as dragged behind the
oxcart but skipping along happily, taking in the beauty of each
moment, they are liberated! This idea is very easy to embrace while
not in slavery, because it offloads responsibility for an individuals
condition onto the individual. It sort of justifies the whole thing.
Case here fails to make real suggestions towards any sort of mass
liberation other than, just imagine it. 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">It stood out to me
in the lecture, the mention of an original idea vs an original
thought. This is interesting to me because there is this struggle
sometimes to make “something new,” which is wholly unproductive
in the activity of making new things. As a thing gets made, it shifts
and move around the person or people that made it, taking them in. 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">I also had this
moment which felt very infinite games where I have to confirm with
NYU my USA Citizenship, the best possible document towards this end
being my passport. What a contradiction! The very identification I
procured from the state in order to travel is in itself the most
solid ground from which to prove my belonging to the society its
existence helps me to escape!</p>
