        First assignment is pages 1-60 of Infinite Games. I have been asking around and researching the book. I got it for under $20 (I paid with a 20 and got dollars back) at McNally Jackson in downtown Brooklyn. I had been there before because Kait's aunt had gotten me a gift card there and we went and I got two books by Philip K. Dick, who I was getting into at the time, last summer.

        I searched "Infinite Games James Case NYC," saw it was on the shelf at 5am this morning and walked over. I had two interactions with the people working there: someone upstairs helped me find it in the self-help section and someone downstairs checked me out. I paid cash and he even knocked a couple bucks off. He looked at it and said, "This is shelf worn," like a wine expert tasting a wine. "This is shelf worn, I'll knock dollars off." Nice.

        I read the first 60 pages, and I read some stuff about the book online. It stood out to me when he quoted Lacan, Hegel, Marx, Jesus, and Paul, but only for single sentences without expounding through references to their other work. Wait... is this guy a pseude? I talked about the book to a friend and he said he read the book as a manual on how to start a cult. On Wikipedia it said a bunch of stuff, and at the bottom, it said the book had mixed reviews. One stood out though, said the book changed his life, from the guy who created Wired magazine and edited on the Whole Earth Catalog, both things I know a little about but not too much, because they're before my time and magazines are so temporal. It's always, the magazine was like this, or it was this way and published this much, it was about this. That's not really how you understand a magazine, or at least, it's difficult for me. I read that it's been used for business, I read that it's underrated in the self-help canon, at this point, I'm like, "Okay, in class we are learning about play theory so I'll interpret the book in this context."

        It stood out to me in the lecture, the mention of an original idea vs an original thought. This is interesting to me because there is this struggle sometimes to make “something new,” which is wholly unproductive in the activity of making new things. As a thing gets made, it shifts and moves around the person or people that made it, taking them in.
